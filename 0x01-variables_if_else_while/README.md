# C - Variables, if, else, while
---------------------------------

We were introduced to variables and control statements in C.

The objectives is for us to learn 

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered **TRUE** and **FALSE** in **C**
- What are the **boolean operators** and how to use them
- How to use the ```if```, ```if ... else``` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types ```char```, ```int```, ```unsigned int```
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type ```char```, ```int```, ```unsigned int``` with ```printf```
- How to use the ```while``` loop
- How to use variables with the ```while``` loop
- How to print variables using ```printf```
- What is the ```ASCII``` character set
- What are the purpose of the ```gcc``` flags ```-m32``` and ```-m64```

### Below are the tasks we completed in this project

|**Scripts			|**Functions**								|
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**0-positive_or_negative**	|This program prints whether the number stored in the variable ```n``` is +ve or -ve|
|**1-last_digit.c**		|This program prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable ```n```    |
|**2-print_alaphabet.c**	|This program prints the alphabet in lowercase.					    |
|**3-print_alphabets**		|This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase		    |
|**4-print_alpabt.c**		|This program prints the alphabet in lowercase except ```q``` and ```e```	    |
|**5-print_numbers**		|This program prints all single digit numbers of base ```10``` starting from``` 0```|
