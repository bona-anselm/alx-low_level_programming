This project fouses on learning how dynamic memory allocation works. We are specifically using the __malloc__ function, __calloc__ does the same thing but differently while __realloc__ is used to increase or extend already allocated memory. The __free__ function is used to return the dynamically allocated memory back to the operating system.
